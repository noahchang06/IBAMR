----------------------------------------------------------------------
Leaflet Mobility:                          0.7
Calcification Index:                  Moderate

FLOW CHARACTERISTICS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cardiac Output:                            5.0 L/min
Regurgitant Volume:                        5.0 mL
Peak Wall Shear Stress:                   80.0 dyne/cm²

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on ACC/AHA Guidelines for Valvular Heart Disease:


Severity: SEVERE AORTIC STENOSIS
Recommendation: AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT INDICATED
  - Symptomatic patients: Class I recommendation (immediate intervention)
  - Asymptomatic with EF <50%: Class I recommendation
  - Consider TAVR vs. surgical AVR based on risk assessment

Risk Factors:
  - High transvalvular pressure gradient (>40 mmHg)
  - Significantly reduced orifice area (<1.0 cm²)
  - Risk of sudden cardiac death if untreated
